# Object-oriented design patterns

The catalog contains various options for implementing OO design patterns and their imitation using a procedural-parametric approach. It is hardly worth calling these simulations patterns, since it is often easier to implement direct solutions in PP programs instead of them due to the greater flexibility in writing code provided by this paradigm. There are several variants of programs that
implement the same design patterns, which is explained by purely subjective circumstances.:

1. A demonstration of patterns and their imitation using geometric shapes as examples is available in the [fig-patterns](fig-patterns) subdirectory. In fact, this is a continuation of manipulations with figs used to demonstrate the evolutionary expansion presented in the corresponding section.

2. Procedural and parametric imitation of examples of OO patterns presented in the form of C++ sources on the website [Refactoring.Guru](https://refactoring.guru/ru/design-patterns/cpp ) By Alexander Shvets. This is the easiest way to show an imitation of patterns based on their ready-made source texts written on the pros. Examples are posted by language and paradigm in the [shvets-patterns](shvets-patterns) subdirectory.

3. The [animals-patterns](animals-patterns) subdirectory contains the OO implementation of patterns, which mainly use animals as examples. They and their procedural-parametric imitations are examples illustrating the comparison of OO and PP paradigms presented in the description on my website: [Procedural-parametric paradigm and OO design patterns (in russian)] (http://www.softcraft.ru/ppp/patterns/intro/). It is possible that their number will increase over time.
